// RunSkill — execute a skill you forged with SkillCraft.
//
// SkillCraft writes handler.js files; this tool runs them. Together they close
// the loop on self-extension: notice a gap -> craft a skill -> run it. The
// handler runs in an isolated child process (see skills/runtime.ts), so a
// crash or hang can never break the turn.
//
// Safety is "external-state": executing arbitrary self-authored code is riskier
// than authoring it, so it passes through the approval gate (except in bypass
// mode) the same way an outward-facing action would.
