// conductor.ts — the deterministic FleetSpec orchestration runtime.
//
// THE GAP THIS FILLS: Task fan-out is MODEL-driven (adjacent parallel-safe Task
// calls batch) — the topology lives in the model's turn choices, so a weak model
// can stop early, skip a phase, or mis-thread a result. The Conductor instead
// takes ONE flat FleetSpec the model emits and executes it start-to-finish in
// deterministic TypeScript: capped fan-out, typed pipeline hand-off, budget
// abort, schema-validated leaf outputs — on ANY provider.
//
// Provider-agnostic BY CONSTRUCTION: every leaf re-enters the ONE QueryEngine
// loop via runForkedTurn, inheriting the parent's provider/model. This module
// never names a provider and never assumes Anthropic JSON-mode/tool-choice.
//
// This file is intentionally ZOD-FREE (@ares/core has no zod dep). Schema
// enforcement is delegated to a pluggable `LeafValidator` the @ares/tools layer
// derives from a shape-example object. Orchestration runs over an INJECTED
// runAgent fn (defaults to runForkedTurn) so the whole runtime is unit-testable
// with a mock runner — no live provider required.
