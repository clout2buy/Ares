// Heap pressure, watched from inside the process that is about to die.
//
// Field origin: coworkers reported "the more I use it the slower it starts to
// work", followed by `The Garrison went down (exit code 134)` — a V8 abort on
// the heap limit. Two things made that unfixable from the outside:
//
//   1. An OOM abort never runs `uncaughtException`. installGlobalCrashHandlers
//      writes nothing, so ~/.ares/crashes was EMPTY for exactly the crash we
//      most needed a record of.
//   2. Nothing measured the climb. The slowdown before the crash is the GC
//      thrashing against a limit it is about to hit, and it was invisible.
//
// So the daemon samples its own heap on a timer. Crossing "elevated" says so
// out loud; crossing "critical" is a request for the host to shed what it can
// (the daemon evicts idle sessions) AND the last chance to leave an artifact
// on disk while the process is still alive to write one.
//
// This module is deliberately pure — it takes readings and returns verdicts —
// so the thresholds and the anti-flap behaviour are testable without having to
// actually exhaust a heap.
