// QueryEngine — the streaming agent loop.
//
// Shape inspired by claude-code-main/src/query.ts and QueryEngine.ts:
//   one QueryEngine per conversation; one streamTurn() per user message.
// Mutable message history carries between turns; the loop continues while
// the assistant emits tool_use blocks.
//
// CONTRACT:
//   - QueryEngine does NOT write to stdout. It yields TurnEvents.
//   - CLI/TUI subscribes to the generator and decides what to render.
//   - All tool execution flows through here; observers see every step.
