// The capabilities ledger — ONE source of truth.
//
// Before this file there were two: the JSON capability graph (what the planner
// reads) and a hand-maintained CAPABILITIES.md (what the model narrates to
// itself). They diverged — the markdown claimed skills the graph had never
// heard of and still pointed at the dead ~/.crix home. Divergent ledgers are
// poison: the entity believes one thing and plans on another.
//
// Resolution: the JSON graph is authoritative. CAPABILITIES.md is GENERATED
// from it (never hand-edited, never trusted by the planner). `renderCapabilities
// Doc` is a pure function of the graph, so the doc can never silently drift —
// regenerate and it matches reality by construction.
