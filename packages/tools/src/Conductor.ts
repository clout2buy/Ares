// Conductor.ts — the model-facing shell over the deterministic runFleet runtime.
//
// The Ares agent AUTHORS a flat FleetSpec (the hardest element it faces is a
// shape-EXAMPLE object, not a JSON-Schema) and the runtime executes it
// start-to-finish. All the stateful failure modes — concurrency caps, abort
// cascade, schema retry, budget abort, pipeline barrier, journaling — live in
// runFleet, which the model never touches. Robust on ANY provider because every
// leaf inherits the parent's provider/model via runForkedTurn.
//
// This file owns the zod binding (the @ares/core runtime is deliberately
// zod-free). The schema seam is derived from a shape-EXAMPLE object so weak
// models can express "I want {summary:'...', score: 0}" without authoring a JSON
// Schema.

const CONDUCTOR_DESCRIPTION = `Author and run a deterministic agent FLEET for work with structure the model-driven Task tool can't guarantee: capped parallel fan-out, typed multi-stage pipelines, schema-validated outputs, build phases that write code, and a token budget.

EASY MODE (preferred for builds): set "plan" to a ONE-LINE goal — e.g. {"plan":"build a browser multiplayer FPS with Node/Vite"} — and the planner expands it into a WIDE research→plan→build→verify fleet for you. Omit "phases" when you use "plan". This is the right call for "build me X": you get a deep, tooled, self-verifying fleet without hand-authoring it.

ADVANCED: emit "phases" yourself. Either way a deterministic runtime executes it start-to-finish — it owns concurrency, cancellation, schema retries, the pipeline hand-off barrier, build-phase write tools, and the budget. You do NOT manage the fan-out turn-by-turn.

REACH FOR THIS for any non-trivial BUILD or research task. DECOMPOSE DEEPLY — fan
5-16 agents across phases, not 3-4. A 3-agent fleet is a review panel, NOT a build:
for "build me X", structure it as research (parallel, wide) → plan (pipeline) →
build (parallel, file-disjoint modules) → verify (a stage that runs the build/tests
and fails closed). Under-decomposing into a few agents is the #1 way a fleet
underdelivers — when in doubt, fan WIDER and add a verify phase.

WHEN TO USE — fan out ONLY for parallelizable read/search/analysis work or isolated write shards (disjoint files/dirs):
- Build something real: research the stack in parallel, then build modules in parallel, then verify.
- Survey N angles in parallel then JUDGE them into one answer (research, design options, code-review panels).
- A pipeline where each stage consumes the PREVIOUS stage's structured output (extract → transform → write).
- Any fan-out where you need a concurrency cap, a token budget, or schema-valid leaf outputs.

BUILD FLEETS MUST BUILD: for any goal that means "produce code" (build/implement/scaffold/develop/rebuild X), a hand-authored fleet with NO build:true phase is REJECTED — research + planning that never writes code is a failed turn, not a deliverable. Keep research to 1-2 phases, then a build phase (build:true, file-disjoint agents) and a verify phase (repairRounds). When unsure how to structure it, use easy mode ({"plan":"..."}) which always ends in build→verify.

WHEN NOT TO USE (rejected or wasteful):
- NEVER for a single-file edit or a task needing shared evolving context — run it inline. A fleet that is one phase with one agent is REJECTED (pure overhead; exception: a lone verify phase with repairRounds).
- A build-goal fleet with no build:true phase is REJECTED (see BUILD FLEETS MUST BUILD) — you would research forever and ship nothing.
- One phase per dependency step; add a new phase (a barrier) ONLY when a step needs ALL prior results. Independent work belongs in ONE parallel phase, not a chain.

WORKED EXAMPLE — a review panel that fans out, then synthesizes:
{ "goal": "review the diff",
  "phases": [
    { "id": "review", "kind": "parallel", "reduce": "judge",
      "judgeInstruction": "Merge into one deduplicated list ranked by severity; drop anything two reviewers didn't both raise.",
      "agents": [
        { "role": "correctness", "prompt": "Review the staged diff for correctness bugs. Return findings.", "tools": ["Read","Grep","Bash"], "schema": {"findings":[{"title":"...","severity":0}]} },
        { "role": "security",    "prompt": "Review the staged diff for security issues. Return findings.", "tools": ["Read","Grep","Bash"], "schema": {"findings":[{"title":"...","severity":0}]} },
        { "role": "perf",        "prompt": "Review the staged diff for performance issues. Return findings.", "tools": ["Read","Grep"], "schema": {"findings":[{"title":"...","severity":0}]} } ] } ],
  "concurrency": 3 }

NOTES:
- 'schema' is a shape-EXAMPLE object (values illustrate types), NOT JSON-Schema.
- reduce: 'judge' adds one synthesis fork over all siblings — far better than 'concat' for panels (you get a merged answer, not N raw opinions to digest yourself).
- In a pipeline, reference the prior stage with {{prev}} / {{prev.field}}; reference an earlier phase with {{phaseId.reduced}}. If a stage's schema fails OR a downstream {{prev.field}} doesn't resolve, the pipeline FAILS CLOSED — it does not run the next stage on garbage.
- TYPED HANDOFF: when the upstream stage declares a schema, every {{prev.field}} you write is checked against it BEFORE the stage runs — referencing a field the schema doesn't declare fails immediately with the declared field list. Only reference fields the upstream schema actually has.
- Each agent is STATELESS — make every prompt self-contained.
- Children run UNATTENDED but CAN research: read-only tools (Read/Grep/Glob/CodebaseSearch/LSP) AND safe research tools (WebFetch/WebSearch/ImageSearch) are available — whitelist them freely on research agents. Write/destructive/credential/payment/account tools are stripped unless the host enabled write mode; serialize writers into a single pipeline stage.
- SELF-REPAIR: put repairRounds (e.g. 3) on your VERIFY phase, whose agent returns schema {"ok":true,"summary":"..."}. If it reports ok:false the runtime re-runs it with the failure injected until green or rounds run out — this is how the fleet catches a broken build and FIXES it before finishing.
- PARALLEL BUILD: to build many modules at once, use kind:'parallel' + build:true with FILE-DISJOINT agents (each owns different files). Isolation defaults to 'worktree' automatically (isolated sandboxes, merged back; an overlap fails closed). To share the workspace directly set isolation:'none' — accepted only when every agent declares a disjoint 'scope' (path prefixes it owns). Serial build is just kind:'pipeline' + build:true.
- If a fleet aborts (budget/time/crash), re-run with resumeFleetId: <the returned fleetId> — completed leaves are reused, only the rest re-runs. The result's 'hints' tell you what to fix.`;
