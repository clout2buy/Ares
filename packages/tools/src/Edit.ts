// Edit — string replacement in a file, resilient to line-ending drift.
//
// Rules (matching Claude Code's Edit semantics, minus the read-first refusal):
//   - If the file was not Read this session, Edit auto-reads and stamps it
//     (ARES_EDIT_AUTO_READ=0 restores the hard "Read it first" deny). The
//     content-hash staleness check + unique-match rule already carry the
//     safety the refusal was meant to provide; the refusal only cost a turn.
//   - old_string must appear exactly once unless replace_all is true.
//   - File content hash must match the last Read stamp (no race with disk edits).
//
// Matching is layered because models reliably reproduce file text with LF line
// endings even when the file on disk is CRLF (the classic Windows edit-killer),
// and often drop trailing whitespace:
//   1. exact match in EOL-normalized space (covers both exact and CRLF-vs-LF)
//   2. trailing-whitespace-insensitive line-block match (single occurrence only)
//   3. diff-anchor / fuzzy match: anchor on the first & last non-blank lines of
//      old_string (the most stable lines under line-shift + reflow drift), then
//      verify the interior modulo leading/trailing whitespace and blank lines. A
//      unique anchored region is replaced; MULTIPLE candidates fail loudly with
//      their line numbers rather than guessing.
// The file's dominant EOL style is preserved on write.

/**
 * Diff-anchor replacement (Layer 3). When both exact and whitespace-tolerant
 * matching miss — typically because interior lines drifted (indentation reflow,
 * a blank line added/removed) or the block moved — we locate the target by its
 * two most stable lines: the first and last NON-BLANK lines of old_string.
 *
 * Algorithm:
 *   1. Reduce old_string to its "significant" lines: non-blank lines with
 *      leading+trailing whitespace collapsed. Need >= 2 to anchor safely (a
 *      single-line target is what the whitespace tier already handles; anchoring
 *      on one line is far too loose to be safe).
 *   2. Find every content line matching the first significant line (whitespace-
 *      insensitive). For each such start, scan forward for the first line
 *      matching the last significant line — that pair bounds a candidate region.
 *   3. Verify the candidate: its significant lines (blank lines dropped, inner
 *      whitespace normalized) must equal old_string's significant lines exactly,
 *      in order. This guards against two blocks that merely share end-lines.
 *   4. If exactly one region verifies, replace the WHOLE region (its literal
 *      lines, blanks included) with new_string. If two or more verify, return
 *      their start line numbers and refuse — the caller turns this into a
 *      "N candidates, add more context" error. Never guess.
