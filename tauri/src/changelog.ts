// The living changelog that powers the "What's New" modal.
//
// One entry per release, NEWEST FIRST. Written for humans, not engineers: every
// highlight is a benefit the user can feel, not a technical note. Keep blurbs to
// a single line. This file is the single source of truth — the modal renders
// straight from it, and the update trigger compares the top entry's `version`
// against the running app version.
//
// Honesty rule: an entry only describes what actually ships in that build. A
// release isn't shipped until the version is bumped and the installer is built,
// so an entry may be written ahead of the features landing — but every line here
// must be true by the time that version reaches a user.
