// Six commands shipped that way and were dead for their entire lifetime: the
// whole persona/roster feature (persona_adopt, persona_write, persona_delete,
// roster_list), the Plan/Build pill (workflow_mode), and the Mind cockpit's
// state read (cognitive_state). A "fix" was even shipped for persona adoption
// that could never have run, because the command never reached the daemon.
//
// Same failure class as the missing ShellSupervisor: fine in dev, dead in the
// packaged app, invisible to every existing test.
