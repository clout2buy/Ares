// Tool-selection floor — the coding core is never pruned away.
//
// selectToolsForTurn() drops the tool list by keyword intent once the belt passes
// 12 tools (a live daemon session carries ~52, so it always fires). The intent
// regex is lexical, which means ordinary coding asks that happen not to contain a
// listed keyword — "add a dark mode toggle", "upgrade the deps", "rename the User
// class everywhere" — used to resolve to a NON-coding turn and ship a tool set with
// no Read/Write/Edit/Grep/Glob at all. The model then emits calls for tools whose
// schemas it was never sent, which surfaces as failed/unknown tool calls and reads
// as "the agent is bad at coding" rather than as a routing bug.
//
// The floor makes the coding core unconditional; intent may only ADD to it. These
// cases are deliberately phrased to MISS the intent regex — that is the point.
//
// The two-tier catalog (tests/tool-tier.test.mjs) replaced the regex router with
// a static core tier + ToolSearch-loaded deferrals; the floor guarantees below
// must hold for it too, so the belt carries ToolSearch to enable deferral.
